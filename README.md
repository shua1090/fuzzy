# Fuzzy
Thank you [@sandkoan](https://github.com/sandkoan), for providing the fuzzy algorithm and introducing me to the world of fuzzy finders.
Code written in python and implemented through curses module.

As of now, the program searches a 235886 long list of english words, but that can be changed to anything (including system paths).

Only works on linux (curses)

To use the code, run main.py
Begin typing in the name of a verb.
Results should start populating below what you type.
Use the arrow (up and down) keys to navigate down or up the results (seen by a ">" on the left of the results)
Use the right arrow key to select one of the verbs. The program will simply exit and use python's builtin print to display your selection.


Sincerely,
    Shynn Lawrence
