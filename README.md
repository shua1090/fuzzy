# fuzzy
Thank you Govind, for providing the fuzzy algorithm and introducing me to the world of fuzzy finders.
Code written in python and implemented through curses module.

As of now, the program searches a 7000 long list of german verbs, but that can be changed to anything (including system paths).

Only works on linux (curses)

Sincerely,
    Shynn Lawrence
